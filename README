sol(iloquy) --- The programmers' editor of your nightmares

SYNOPSIS
--------
sol [*OPTIONS*] [*file* [...]]

DESCRIPTION

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Soliloquy is a highly extensible, non-visual editor with modern features, which
include:

- Automatic indentation
- Automatic word-wrap
- Syntax highlighting
- Fast line editing
- Multiple buffers
- Infinite undo

If you are able to effectively use Soliloquy, you are probably able to work
with C. Therefore, _there is no external configuration_; all "configuration"
is performed by editing the C source and recompiling. (See HACKING for
details.)

Buffers
~~~~~~~
At any given time, a Soliloquy session has one or more buffers. Each buffer is
composed of some number of lines, and a cursor position, which refers to a
location *between* two lines. Buffers can be referred to by number or by name.

Each buffer is associated with a _major mode_ and zero or more _minor modes_;
these are similar to, but also rather different from, the equinominal concepts
in Emacs. The major mode defines the way the buffer is translated to/from its
backing store, such as files, and may place limitations on the format of lines
entered. Minor modes layer themselves between the user and the buffer and/or
line editors to provide additional functionality to the user.

Line Editors
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Operations which insert new lines or edit existing ones create line
editors. Line editors allow stateful editing of the characters on a line,
similar to programs using libreadline, and are separate entities from buffers,
though they share the same name and number space.
