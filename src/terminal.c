/*
  SYMBOL: $c_Terminal
    Encapsulates the state of a single connected terminal. $p_Terminal_input,
    $p_Terminal_output, and $s_Terminal_type *must* be specified when the
    constructor is called. Call $f_Terminal_destroy when a terminal is to be
    disconnected. Subclass of $c_Consumer.

  SYMBOL: $lo_terminals
    A list of all currently-initialised Terminal objects, in no particular
    order.

  SYMBOL: $s_Terminal_type
    The type of the connected terminal; that is, the contents of its TERM
    environment variable.

  SYMBOL: $p_Terminal_input
    A FILE* used for terminal input. It is owned strictly by this Terminal, and
    will be fclose()d when the Terminal is destroyed.

  SYMBOL: $p_Terminal_output
    A FILE* used for terminal output. It is owned strictly by this Terminal,
    and will be fclose()d when the Terminal is destroyed.

  SYMBOL: $y_Terminal_ok
    Set to true in the Terminal constructor if initialisation is
    successful. If it is false, the terminal has not been initialised and
    should be simply discarded (though the FILE* handles in $p_Terminal_input
    and $p_Terminal_output have not been closed).

  SYMBOL: $i_Terminal_rows $i_Terminal_cols
    The current number of rows (lines) or columns present on the Terminal.

    The character value read in the most recent call to get_wch (ie, in
    $f_Terminal_read). If $i_Terminal_input_type is 0, this is the Unicode
    value of the character the user typed.

  SYMBOL: $f_Terminal_putch
    Writes the value of *$q_qch to the terminal at coordinates ($i_x,$i_y),

    refresh before the next kernel cycle.

  SYMBOL: $f_translate_qchar_to_ncurses
    Used by $f_Terminal_putch to translate qchars to their most equivalent
    representation in ncurses. It is called once per character that needs
    updating. The function is to read from the first character of $q_qch and
    write into the ncurses cchar_t pointed to by $p_wch.

  SYMBOL: $q_qch $p_wch
    Used as input and output arguments to $f_translate_qchar_to_ncurses,
    respectively. Only the first character of $q_qch is relevant. $p_wch points
    to a stack-allocated cchar_t, and has undefined value outside of a call to
    $f_translate_qchar_to_ncurses.

  SYMBOL: $i_x $i_y
    Coordinates for $f_Terminal_putch.

  SYMBOL: $u_Terminal_refresh
    Identifies the hook used to refresh the terminal.
