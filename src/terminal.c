/*
  SYMBOL: $c_Terminal
    Encapsulates the state of a single connected terminal. $p_Terminal_input,
    $p_Terminal_output, and $s_Terminal_type *must* be specified when the
    constructor is called. Call $f_Terminal_destroy when a terminal is to be
    disconnected. Subclass of $c_Consumer.

  SYMBOL: $lo_terminals
    A list of all currently-initialised Terminal objects, in no particular
    order.

  SYMBOL: $s_Terminal_type
    The type of the connected terminal; that is, the contents of its TERM
    environment variable.

  SYMBOL: $p_Terminal_input
    A FILE* used for terminal input. It is owned strictly by this Terminal, and
    will be fclose()d when the Terminal is destroyed.

  SYMBOL: $p_Terminal_output
    A FILE* used for terminal output. It is owned strictly by this Terminal,
    and will be fclose()d when the Terminal is destroyed.

  SYMBOL: $y_Terminal_ok
    Set to true in the Terminal constructor if initialisation is
    successful. If it is false, the terminal has not been initialised and
    should be simply discarded (though the FILE* handles in $p_Terminal_input
    and $p_Terminal_output have not been closed).

  SYMBOL: $i_Terminal_num_colours $i_Terminal_num_colour_pairs
    These reflect the values of the curses variables COLORS and COLOR_PAIRS at
    the time the terminal was created. See color(3ncurses).

  SYMBOL: $i_Terminal_rows $i_Terminal_cols
    The current number of rows (lines) or columns present on the Terminal.
