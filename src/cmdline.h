#ifndef CMDLINE_H_

/**
 * Defines a command-line argument. short and long are *unquoted* strings which
 * specify the short (single-char) and long (string) argument forms; words in
 * long *must* be separated by underscores; they will be changed to hyphens for
 * presentation/parsing. If short is a bare hyphen, this argument has no short
 * form.
 *
 * Argspec is either `none` (no quotes), which indicates that the argument
 * takes no parameter, or a variable identifier which is used both in the help
 * string and as the name of the string parameter to the handler.
 *
 * helpstring is a quoted string which explains the function of the argument.
 *
 * This macro both binds the handler to the argument and defines the handler
 * itself. Example:
 *
 * def_cmdline_arg(h, say_hello, name, "Greet the person defined by <name>.") {
 *   printf("Hello, %s\n", name);
 * }
 *
 * The help string for this argument would look something like this:
 *   -h, --say-hello=<name>
 *       Greet the person defined by <name>.
 *
 * The argument could be used as
 *   sol -hworld
 * or
 *   sol --say-hello=world
