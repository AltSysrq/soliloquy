linum-mode --- Show line numbers in the meta area
=================================================

Description
-----------
linum-mode extends BufferEditor to show line number information in the line
meta area. It can show both absolute and relative line numbers, displaying the
latter as the characters that can be used to jump to those lines with one
relative line keystroke.

When absolute line numbers do not fit within the meta area, the uppermost
digits share the leftmost column, and the display rotates between them, most
significant to least significant digit, using different highlightings to
indicate the unit for that digit.

Configuration
-------------
All configuration is described in linum.c

Weight -- Inactive
------------------
About 100 bytes of constant memory usage; about 50 bytes extra space per
BufferEditor; one dead hook on $f_RenderedLine_gen_meta.

Weight -- Active
----------------
linum-mode, when active, incurs the logic needed to format the line numbers, as
well as an additional memory allocation and copy equal to the line meta size,
every time a line is to be formatted (eg, printed to the screen, or shown on
the echo area).
