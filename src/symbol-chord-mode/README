symbol-chord-mode --- Press 2-key chords to insert symbols
==========================================================

Description
-----------
symbol-chord-mode allows you to insert common programming symbols using
two-finger key chords on or near the home row. How useful this is depends on
your hands, your keyboard, and your keyboard layout.

The default symbol mapping can be found in the source file. Whenever you type
two characters within $I_LineEditor_symbol_chord_duration_ms milliseconds of
each other (default is 35 milliseconds), which essentially means you pressed
them simultaneously,, the mapping is checked. If a match is found, that is, the
previous character and the new one compose a chord (which is independent of the
order the characters were received), the previous character you typed is
deleted, and the input is altered to look like you typed the mapped character.

Finding an appropriate delay can be difficult. If you are a fast typist, it may
be especially hard to find a happy medium. Too low an interval can make it
impossible to enter the chords, whereas to high an interval will make Soliloquy
detect separate keystrokes as chords. The default delay of 35ms was found to
work well for the author within urxvt.

Configuration
-------------
Documented in symbol_chord.c.

Weight -- Inactive
------------------
One dead hook per normal character insertion into a LineEditor. About 32 bytes
of memory per LineEditor.

Weight -- Active
----------------
One poll of a system clock per character insertion into a LineEditor. When
multiple keystrokes occur within $I_LineEditor_symbol_chord_duration_ms,
incurrs an additional loop whose runtime is proportional to the length of
$w_LineEditor_symbol_chords.
