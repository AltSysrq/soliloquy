  TITLE: Adapter for line-formatting functions
  OVERVIEW: Adapts the interface of BufferEditor and LineEditor to support
    reformatting the text they display, including the repositioning of the
    cursor, via a simple two-hook interface.
 */

/*
  SYMBOL: $u_line_format_adapter
    Identifies the hooks inserted by the line format adapter.

  SYMBOL: $f_line_format_check
    Hooks should examine the string in $q_line_format to determine whether
    there is any reason for them to alter it. If there is, they must set
    $y_line_format_change to true; otherwise, they must leave it alone. If the
    size of the string is to be altered, $I_line_format_size should be altered
    appropriately, by adjusting it by relative size. Hooks may not assume that
    $I_line_format_size reflects the actual length of the string -- it may have
    been altered by other hooks. Generally, shrinking the string is a bad idea,
    since hooks could interact poorly (eg, reducing the size below zero).

  SYMBOL: $f_line_format_move
    Performs in-place formatting adjustments on the string in
    $Q_line_format. Hooks may change the size of the string; if they do so,
    they must maintain $I_line_format_point such that it remains indexing the
    same logical character.

  SYMBOL: $q_line_format
    Input for string $f_line_format_check().

  SYMBOL: $Q_line_format
    Input/output string for $f_line_format_move(). When that function is
    called, it has already been initialised.

  SYMBOL: $Q_line_format_back
    Set when $f_line_format_move() is called if
    $y_line_format_needs_back_buffer was true. It is a buffer of equal size to
    $Q_line_format, but initially uninitialised. Operations which would be able
    to execute more efficiently by copying from one buffer to another may want
    this; if they do, they should first swap $Q_line_format and
    $Q_line_format_back, then copy from the latter to the former.

  SYMBOL: $I_line_format_size
    The size of the final string to be produced by $f_line_format_move(). See
    documentation on $f_line_format_check() and $f_line_format_move() for
    details.

  SYMBOL: $I_line_format_point
    The index of the user's point within $Q_line_format, which must be
    maintained if characters within are rearranged.

  SYMBOL: $y_line_format_change
    If set to true by a hook on $f_line_format_check(), the string in question
    will be replaced, and $f_line_format_move() will be called.

  SYMBOL: $y_line_format_needs_back_buffer
    If true, $Q_line_format_back is initialised before calling
    $f_line_format_move().
