control-character-display-mode --- Show control chars in human-readable format
==============================================================================

Description
-----------
Reformats line contents of BufferEditors and LineEditors to display control
characters in human-readable format.

Lines containing only a form-feed character are replaced by a horizontal line.

Horizontal tabulator characters are treated differently according whether they
are (consecutively) at the beginning of the line or elsewhere. Tabs at the
beginning of the line are directly converted into a fixed number of
spaces. Others cause spaces to be inserted until the column number is a
multiple of the middle tab width. In both cases, the first inserted character
is a non-space to indicate the presence of the tabulator.

Other control characters are shown in the customary '^X' syntax.

Configuration
-------------
All configuration described in ctrl_chr_dsp_mode.c.

Weight -- Inactive
------------------
One to two dead hooks per line output event (including showing lines to the
echo area). About 50 bytes of additional memory per Activity.

Weight -- Active
----------------
In most cases, one extra read pass through a line to be output. Sometimes,
incurrs an additional memory allocation and string copy.
