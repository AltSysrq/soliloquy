  TITLE: Translates formatted characters into ncurses cchar_ts.
  OVERVIEW: This file is responsible for the handling the rendition of
    characters on the terminal. You will want to change things here if your
    terminal interprets things unusually (ie, blinking) or if you want to
    change the way formatting is converted to what your terminal understands.
    If you just want to change the formatting or colours which are used, you
    probably want to edit faces_conf.c.

/*
  Define one of these three. OPAQUE means that your entire terminal is solidly
  shaded with background colour 0. This is the most conservative setting, and
  is the only one available on non-ncurses implementations of curses.

  TRANSPARENT remaps all usage a non-bright background black to the "default"
  colour. On real terminals, this generally is no different from
  OPAQUE. However, in emulators like urxvt, the default background may be
  transparent (ie, shows your desktop wallpaper); thus, all cells with
  non-coloured backgrounds will have a transparent background, rendering the
  text on top of your wallpaper (or whatever it is your favourite terminal
  does). If you use this, you will probably need to define
  BLINK_ACTUALLY_BLINKS (see below) since the default background will actually
  be used.

  TRANSLUSCENT is a hybrid of the two. It behaves like OPAQUE for all
  characters other than the NUL character with a black background, for which it
  behaves like TRANSPARENT. Thus, the empty parts of your terminal allow your
  wallpaper to show through, while areas with text have a solid background and
  are thus easy to read. Unlike with TRANSPARENT, you probably won't have to
  worry about BLINK_ACTUALLY_BLINKS.

  TRANSLUSCENT_SOUP is like TRANSLUSCENT, except that space characters also use
  the default background.

/*
  Define zero, one, or both of these based on whether your terminal makes
  bright characters bold, and bold characters bright, respectively. An example
  of the former is the Emacs terminal-emulator; of the latter is urxvt.

  Bold-implies-bright is a mixed blessing. On the down side, it makes it
  impossible to get a non-bright foreground without a bright background. On the
  other hand, it's also the only way to get both a bright foreground and
  background.

  terminal and the BG_TRANSPARENT setting, you will need to make the bright
  black background transparent instead.
