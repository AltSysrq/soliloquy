  TITLE: Core Keybindings
  OVERVIEW: Sets up the basic keybindings for things like the handling of the
    escape key and such.
*/

/*
  SYMBOL: $u_meta
    The key mode used after escape has been pressed in the ground state (most
    commonly, this occurs due to holding Meta with the key, which sends escape
    followed by another key).

  SYMBOL: $u_extended
    Key mode for extended mnemonic commands. By default, entered by pressing ^X.

  SYMBOL: $u_extended_meta
    Key mode when Escape was read while in the $u_extended key mode. See also
    $u_meta.
