  TITLE: Basic TTY Emulator
  OVERVIEW: Provides the very basic infastructure for tty emulation, excluding
    control sequences and such.
 */

/*
  SYMBOL: $c_TtyEmulator
    Encapsulates the data and operations for a primitive terminal emulator.

  SYMBOL: $aax_TtyEmulator_screen
    The current contents of the TtyEmulator. It is not necessarily a
    rectangular array. The outer array contains the rows, and must have a
    length of at least one. The initial value has one row whose size is
    $i_column_width.

  SYMBOL: $ay_TtyEmulator_dirty
    Tracks which rows of $aax_TtyEmulator_screen are dirty; that is, those that
    have been modified since the last call to $m_update(). Its length must be
    the same as that of $aax_TtyEmulator_screen.

  SYMBOL: $I_TtyEmulator_x $I_TtyEmulator_y
    The coordinates within $aax_TtyEmulator_screen of the next character to be
    output.

  SYMBOL: $I_TtyEmulator_ninputs
    The number of TtyConsumers providing inputs to this TtyEmulator.

  SYMBOL: $f_TtyEmulator_addch
    Adds the character $z_TtyEmulator_wch to the output. The default places the
    character at the cursor and advances the cursor if it is not a control
    character, or calls $m_control_character() otherwise.

  SYMBOL: $f_TtyEmulator_control_character
    Called by $f_TtyEmulator_addch when $z_TtyEmulator_wch is a control
    character. The default does nothing.

    The wchar_t to add in a call to $f_TtyEmulator_addch and

    The current face for new characters output to this TtyEmulator.
