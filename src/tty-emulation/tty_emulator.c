  TITLE: Basic TTY Emulator

    control sequences and such.
 */

/*
  SYMBOL: $c_TtyEmulator
    Encapsulates the data and operations for a primitive terminal emulator.

  SYMBOL: $aaz_TtyEmulator_screen
    The current contents of the TtyEmulator. It is not necessarily a
    rectangular array. The outer array contains the rows, and must have a
    length of at least one. The initial value has one row whose size is
    $i_column_width.

  SYMBOL: $I_TtyEmulator_x $I_TtyEmulator_y
    The coordinates within $aaz_TtyEmulator_screen of the next character to be
    output.

  SYMBOL: $I_TtyEmulator_ninputs
    The number of TtyConsumers providing inputs to this TtyEmulator.

  SYMBOL: $f_TtyEmulator_addch
    Adds the character $z_TtyEmulator_wch to the output. The default places the

    character, or calls $m_control_character() otherwise.

  SYMBOL: $f_TtyEmulator_control_character
    Called by $f_TtyEmulator_addch when $z_TtyEmulator_wch is a control
    character. The default does nothing.

  SYMBOL: $z_TtyEmulator_wch
    The wchar_t to add in a call to $f_TtyEmulator_addch and
