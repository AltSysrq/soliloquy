  TITLE: TTY Emulation Consumer
  OVERVIEW: Provides a class to read bytes from a file descriptor and feed
    up-converted characters into the TTY Emulator.
 */

/*
  SYMBOL: $c_TtyConsumer
    Consumer which pulls individual bytes from the input stream, up-converts
    them to wide characters, and passes them onto a TtyEmulator. The file
    descriptor MUST be opened in non-blocking mode.

  SYMBOL: $p_TtyConsumer_mbstate
    A mbstate_t* which stores the current multibyte state.

  SYMBOL: $S_TtyConsumer_wchbuf $I_TtyConsumer_wchbuf
    An array of MB_LEN_MAX chars which stores the current multibyte
    sequence. $I_TtyConsumer_wchbuf points to the first index currently
    unused.

  SYMBOL: $f_TtyConsumer_read
    Reads bytes from the file descriptor until it would block or hits EOF,
    up-converting them to wide characters and passing them onto the underlying
    emulator. On EOF, calls $m_destroy().

  SYMBOL: $o_TtyConsumer_emulator
    The TtyEmulator driven by this TtyConsumer.
