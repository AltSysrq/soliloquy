  TITLE: TTY Emulation of Basic Control Characters
  OVERVIEW: Extends the basic TtyEmulator to understand some ASCII control
    characters, such as line-feed and carraige-return.
 */

/*
  SYMBOL: $u_line_feed_support
    Identifies the hook on $h_TtyEmulator_control_character which adds support
    for the line feed (\n) character. A line feed causes the cursor X to be set
    to zero, and the Y incremented if not at the bottom, or the screen scrolled
    if already at the bottom.

/*
  SYMBOL: $u_carraige_return_support

  SYMBOL: $u_form_feed_support
    Identifies the hook on $h_TtyEmulator_control_character which adds support
    for the form feed (\f) character. A form feed calls $m_scroll() a number of
    times equal to the number of rows in $aaz_TtyEmulator_screen, then resets
    the cursor X and Y to the origin.
