  TITLE: Kill Ring Management
  OVERVIEW: Provides functions to manage the Emacs-style kill ring. Note that
    there are two separate kill rings: one for character-level editing, and one
    for line-level.
 */

/*
  SYMBOL: $aw_c_kill_ring $aaw_l_kill_ring
    The character-oriented and line-oriented kill rings, respectively. The most
    recently-killed item is recorded in $I_c_kill_ring and $I_l_kill_ring,
    respectively. Note that both may have NULL entries at arbitrary locations.

  SYMBOL: $I_c_kill_ring $I_l_kill_ring
    The indices into $aw_c_kill_ring and $aaw_l_kill_ring, respectively, of the
    most recently killed item.

  dynar_expand_by_aw($aaw_l_kill_ring, 8);

/*
  SYMBOL: $f_c_kill
    Kills a string of text, modifying the character-oriented kill ring
    appropriately. This should only be called once per logical command;
    otherwise, the results will be rather unintuitive. The string to kill is
    stored in $w_kill. $v_kill_direction must also be set appropriately.

  SYMBOL: $w_kill
    The string to kill in a call to $f_c_kill.

  SYMBOL: $v_kill_direction
    In a call to $f_c_kill() or $f_l_kill(), the direction relative to the
    cursor of the killed text. This should be either $u_forward or
    $u_backward.

  SYMBOL: $y_LastCommand_was_c_kill
    When true in the context of $o_prev_command, $f_c_kill() will concatenate
    the newly-killed text instead of creating a new entry.

  SYMBOL: $u_forward $u_backward
    In kill functions, identify the direction of the killed text relative to
    the cursor.
