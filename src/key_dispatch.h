/**
 * This file defines the basic interface to the key dispatch system.
 *
 * At any given time, there is a current "key mode" ($v_Terminal_key_mode)
 * which affects which keybindings have effect. They are indended for meta keys
 * and key sequences like the C-x bindings in Emacs, though they can also be
 * used to make the editor modal like Vi.
 *
 * Each time the user presses a key, the following keymaps are searched:
 *   $llp_Terminal_keymap (in the terminal on which the key press occurred)
 *   $llp_View_keymap (in $o_Terminal_view)
 *   $llp_Workspace_keymap (in $o_View_workspace)
 *   $llp_Backing_keymap (in $o_Workspace_backing)
 *   $llp_Activity_keymap (from top to bottom of $lo_Workspace_activities)
 *
 * Each keymap is a list of lists of pointers to keybinding structures. The
 * two-dimensionality of the list is only to ease management of keymaps; they
 * are effectively flattened when searched.
 *
 * Searching is performed in two passes for each level of searching. On the
 * first pass, the exact keystroke ($x_Terminal_input_value) is compared
 * against keybindings' triggers, respecting mode. If no such keybinding is
 * found, the search is repeated searching as if KEYBINDING_DEFAULT had been
 * typed. If that search is also unsuccessful, $f_key_undefined() is called.
 *
 * Handler functions are called within the context of the object whose keymap
 * it was found within, as well as within the contexts of the objects searched
 * first. The exception is Activities, for which only the Activity which the
 * keymap was found in will be eviscerated, in addition to the Workspace and
 * everything above it (versus all Activities thereto and the Backing being
 * eviscerated as well).
 *
 * Any handling function may set $y_key_dispatch_continue to true to indicate
 * that it has not processed the keystroke, which causes the search to continue
 * as if that keybinding were not present in the keymap.
