  TITLE: Workspace Management
  OVERVIEW: Manages Workspaces, global objects associated with a Backing, an
  Echo area, and an activity stack.
*/
//class $c_Backing $c_Clip

/*
  SYMBOL: $c_Workspace
    Creates a new Workspace bound to the backing in $o_Workspace_backing. The
    Workspace picks the lowest available workspace number and adds itself to
    the global workspace list.

  SYMBOL: $lo_Workspace_activities
    The current activity stack for this Workspace. The current activity is the
    entry on the top of the stack.

  SYMBOL: $o_Backing_default_activity
    The default activity for a given Backing. If this is not set for a
    particular Backing, you won't be able to do much with a Workspace backed by
    it.

  SYMBOL: $lo_Workspace_pins
    A list of Clips which are pinned to this Workspace.

  SYMBOL: $i_Workspace_number
    The number of this Workspace, which generally will not change once the
    Workspace is created (though it can be changed). The first Workspace number
    is zero; when each Workspace is constructed, it chooses the lowest
    available Workspace number.

  SYMBOL: $lo_workspaces
    A list of all existing Workspaces.

  SYMBOL: $o_Workspace_backing
    The Backing object which stores the contents of this Workspace.

  SYMBOL: $f_Workspace_add_pin
    Adds the current Clip ($o_Clip) to this Workspace's pin list. After this
    call, the Clip belongs to the Workspace, and will be destroyed when the
    Workspace is destroyed.

  SYMBOL: $f_Workspace_pin_changed
    Called whenever any modification to the Workspace's pin list occurs.

  SYMBOL: $f_Workspace_remove_pin
    Removes $o_Clip from this Workspace's pin list. The Clip is not destroyed;
    it becomes the caller's responsibility after this call. This should be
    called within the context of the clip, so that no long-term reference to it
    is created.

  SYMBOL: $f_Workspace_destroy_pin
    Calls $f_Workspace_remove_pin, then destroys $o_Clip. This must be called
    within the context of $o_Clip. This is both due to how it calls
    $f_Clip_destroy(), and because this prevents passing the Clip in a manner
    which would preserve a reference to it after the call exits.
