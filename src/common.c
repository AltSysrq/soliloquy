/**
 * Evisceration of an object is performed as follows:
 * - Eviscerate its parent, if present
 * - For each symbol implanted within this object:
 *   - If the symbol currently has an owner, write its current value back into
 *     the owner's data
 *   - Push the owner stack to indicate this object as its new owner
 *   - Write the object's value of the symbol into the symbol
 *
 * Re-embowelment is similar to the reverse of that:
 * - For each symbol implanted within this object:
 *   - Write the current value back into this object's data
 *   - Pop its owner stack
 *   - If it still has an owner, copy the new owner's value for the symbol into
 *     the symbol
 * - Re-embowel the parent, if present
 *
 * This set-up (versus simply creating backups of the symbols' values) has a
 * number of important properties:
 * - The current value of a symbol within the context of an object is always
 *   either the symbol's value iff the object is currently that symbol's value,
 *   or the symbol's value as stored within the object otherwise.
 * - An object may be eviscerated multiple times on the stack and will function
 *   as expected.
 * - In cases of multiple-evisceration, writes to a symbol in a lower
 *   evisceration frame will propagate to those symbols' values when the upper
 *   evisceration frame becomes visible.
