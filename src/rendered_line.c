  TITLE: Rendered Line
  OVERVIEW: Encapsulates a line of text already prepared to be displayed to the
    screen, complete with metadata.

  SYMBOL: $c_Rendered_Line
    Encapsulates a line of text already prepared to be displayed to the
    screen. A fully-constructed Rendered_Line has its $q_Rendered_Line_meta and
    $q_Rendered_Line_body symbols set. When constructed, if
    $q_Rendered_Line_meta is NULL, $m_gen_meta() is called to
    generate it.

  SYMBOL: $q_Rendered_Line_body
    The formatted text of the line itself.

  SYMBOL: $q_Rendered_Line_meta
    The metadata for the line, in formatted text format.

  SYMBOL: $H_gen_meta
    Method on Rendered_Line. Called from $f_Rendered_Line() if
    $q_Rendered_Line_meta was NULL. When this is called, $q_Rendered_Line_meta
    has been initialised to a qchar array of length (1 + $i_line_meta_width),
    filled with NULs. Hooks to this point should populate at most
    $i_line_meta_width of characters, and should not alter characters set to
    non-NUL values by hooks that run before them (though changing formatting is
    acceptable).
