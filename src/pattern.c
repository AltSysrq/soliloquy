  SYMBOL: $f_pseudo_steno_expand $w_pseudo_steno_expand
    Attempts to perform "pseudo-stenographic" expansion of
    $w_pseudo_steno_expand, by querying $p_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator. If
    the search is successful, $w_pseudo_steno_expand is set to the expanded
    string. Otherwise, it is set to NULL.
    --
    Pseudo-stenographic expansion is performed as follows. Given an input and a
    set of possible completions, the completions are first narrowed to a list
    of candidates according to those which satisfy all of the following
    criteria:
    - The candidate begins with the same character as the input.
    - The input's character sequence is a subsequence of that of the candidate.
    - It is possible to match this subsequence to the candidate such that no
      word boundaries occur between two characters in the input which
      themselves did not constitute a word boundary.
    The last criterion means that, given an input of "slq", "soliloquy" will be
    a candidate, whereas "sillyIraq" is not.
    Once a list of candidate matches is obtained, a match is selected according
    to the following criteria, considered in the order given:
    - The candidate(s) with the fewest word boundaries.
    - The shortest candidate(s).
    - The candidate with the latest occurrance of inserted characters.
    - The candidate whose first inserted character is more common, ignoring
      inserted characters between the candidates which are equal. Character
      commonness is a static table of English letter probabilities (noting
      that most programming occurs in English). This rule takes into account
      the fact that people are more likely to be explicit about the less
      common characters, while expecting common ones (like 'e') to be
      inserted. Non-ASCII leters are not handled here; they are considered to
      be less frequent than any ASCII letter.
    - Choose the one which comes first, sorting according to Unicode code
      points. This is simply a tie-breaker for consistency.
    --
    There is a concept of "subsequences" (see
    $p_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator); if a match is found for a subsequence,
    subsequent subsequences will not be searched. This can be used, for
    example, to give precedence to identifiers in code proper over words which
    happen to occur in comments.
    --
    Inputs of zero or one characters will always fail to match.
    --
    This function uses a somewhat different definition of "word boundary" when
    examining the input (but not the candidates) --- consecutive uppercase
    characters shall also be considered to constitute word boundaries. This is
    to allow for abbreviations like "DoBF" to mean "DocumentBuilderFactory",
    which is esspecially useful for environments like Java.

  SYMBOL: $p_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator $x_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator
  SYMBOL: $w_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator $y_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator
    $p_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator is a function pointer of type
    `void (*)(void)`. It is called repeadedly by $f_pseudo_steno_expand to
    enumerate possible expansions of the expansion query. It must set
    $w_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator to either an enumerated string, or NULL
    to indicate end of subsequence. It SHOULD only return strings whose first
    character is equal to $x_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator, but MAY return
    strings which do not fit this criterion. It MUST NOT return an empty
    string. It must set $y_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator to false to indicate
    that it cannot enumerate any more strings; in this case, the value in
    $w_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator MUST be NULL.
    --
    The separation of end-of-subsequence (by returning NULL) and
    end-of-enumeration (by setting $y_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator to false)
    allow for separating possible completions into multiple levels of
    priority. The function will only be polled for more data after the end of a
    subsequence if no completion could be found in the previous.
    --
    The contents of $p_pseudo_steno_expand_enumerator may be changed during
    execution; this will have the expected result of changing the function
    called.
    --
    $w_pseudo_steno_expand MUST NOT be altered by this function.
