#ifndef INTERACTIVE_H_
#define INTERACTIVE_H_

/**
 * Creates an interactive/programatic function pair. The interactive funtion is
 * named _name_, and will obtain user input as requested by the specs in the
 * tail arguments. Once all arguments are obtained, the programatic function
 * named _bound_ will be called, which will be in the same context as where the
 * interactive function was invoked, save for an extra object which stores the
 * interactive parameters.
 *
 * Both name and bound must be $h symbols.
 *
 * Example:
 *   interactive($h_insert_n_chars_i, $h_insert_n_chars,
 *               i_(z, $z_ch, L"Character"), i_(I,$I_cnt, L"Count")) {
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 * The i_() marco below handles the most generic cases of interactive input. It
 * is possible to easily extend the interactive system; simply define a macro
 * which takes a symbol (and whatever else you need), implants the symbol into
 * the current context, and registers the argument into
 * $ao_Interactive_arguments (which should be done by calling a function
 * declared in your header, since Silc won't generate that symbol in the user's
 * compilation unit unless they reference it themselves).
